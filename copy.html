      <h2>María Conchita Alonso, the star of the program</h2>
      <p>One of the Boys is an American sitcom created by Blake Hunter and Martin Cohan that aired six episodes on NBC from April 15 to May 20, 1989. It is one of only a few American primetime programs that decade to star a Latin American woman—María Conchita Alonso. She featured as Maria Conchita Navarro, a Venezuelan immigrant to the United States who begins working in the office of a small construction company and marries its widowed owner, Mike Lukowski (Robert Clohessy). Five production companies oversaw filming at Sunset Gower Studios in Hollywood, where delays prevented critics from watching a preview in advance of the premiere. Reviews referred to the concept as ordinary and a repeat of themes from other television shows at that time. Alonso's acting was mostly praised by critics. The mid-season replacement received inconsistent Nielsen ratings and was not renewed for a second season by NBC.</p>
